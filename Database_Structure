The influx data base associated with moisture data monitoring of LaCima Ranch is listed below

Currently only one data base is used to store data.
The data base is ->  moisture_data
Each data base can contain measurement series
Currently there is only one series  moisture_a
( Expect other series in the future like evaporative loss data )

the structure of the records in the moisture_a data base is as follows

Tag keys.  ( These keys are used to identify the record, but I have not found a way to use select on them)

namespace
sensor_number
time_stamp

Field keys ( These keys are actual data and can be used in the select statements )

fieldKey         fieldType
--------         ---------
air_humidity     float  degrees f
air_temperature  float  degree -f
configuration    float ( 0 == not used, 1 = Watermark Gypsum, 2 = Resistive sensor )
depth            float ( dept in inches)
description      string
namespace        string ( see remark below)
resistive        float ohms
sensor_number    integer ( each remote unit has up to 16 sensors )
soil_temperature float degree F
time_stamp       string  date-time measurement was taken
value            float either ohm or cb for watermark


Note on namespace.  Namespace is based upon graphical database used to build the system.  
The general form is [ Relation ~ Label] value : Semicolon is end marker

Right now my Relation and label are set to the same value.

The sequence is the following progression
SYSTEM
SITE
DATA_STORE
MOISTURE_STORE -- moisture measurement
MOISTURE_DATA  -- indvidual measurement

in the actual data the key and data are concatented together.  Will work on that in future.

example of name_sate

u'namespace_1': u'[SYSTEM~SYSTEM]LaCima Operations:
                  [SITE~SITE]LaCima:
                  [DATA_STORE~DATA_STORE]LaCima_DataStore:
                  [MOISTURE_STORE~MOISTURE_STORE]MOISTURE_STORE:
                  [MOISTURE_DATA~MOISTURE_DATA]moisture_1:', 
                  u'namespace':
                  u'[SYSTEM~SYSTEM]LaCima Operations:
                  [SITE~SITE]LaCima:
                  [DATA_STORE~DATA_STORE]LaCima_DataStore:
                  [MOISTURE_STORE~MOISTURE_STORE]MOISTURE_STORE:
                  [MOISTURE_DATA~MOISTURE_DATA]moisture_1:'
                  
 In influxdb the data base is fixed by specifing the db or issuing a USE DATABASE command.
 select statements apply to series in the database
 
currently the select statement has the following form
"select * from moisture_a "
or 
select value, depth, sensor_number from moisture_a where depth < 10.

also time is allowed as a query object as time is an implicit field

select value, depth, sensor_number from moisture_a where time > "2017-04-04"
