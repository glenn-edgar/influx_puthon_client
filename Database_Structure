The influx data base associated with moisture data monitoring of LaCima Ranch is listed below

Currently only one data base is used to store data.
The data base is ->  moisture_data
Each data base can contain measurement series
Currently there is only one series  moisture_d   NOTE THE CHANGE !!!!
( Expect other series in the future like evaporative loss data )

the structure of the records in the moisture_a data base is as follows

Correction --> tag keys as well as field keys can be used in select statement.
               if a tag and field has the same key which is not a good idea
               then use <tag_key>::tag and <field_key>::field  to distingush 

Tags and Fields were rearranged to make a more efficient data base

time_stamp tag was dropped there is a time field that influxdb uses



The tag fields are

configuration   --- type of sensor  currently 1 or 2  
description     --- note about the sensor
                --- if the sensor is moved then the description will be changed and a new series starts
namespace       --- used to id moisture controller data
sensor_number   --- used to id sensor number of moisture controller 0-15 for current model


tags are strings.  only fields can be sorted numerically.  That is why sensor depth is put in field key even though the depth does not 
change.


fieldKey         fieldType
--------         ---------
air_humidity     float  degrees f
air_temperature  float  degree -f
depth            float ( dept in inches)
resistive        float ohms
soil_temperature float degree F
value            float either ohm or cb for watermark


Note on namespace.  Namespace is based upon graphical database used to build the system.  
The general form is [ Relation ~ Label] value : Semicolon is end marker

Right now my Relation and label are set to the same value.

The sequence is the following progression
SYSTEM
SITE
DATA_STORE
MOISTURE_STORE -- moisture measurement
MOISTURE_DATA  -- indvidual measurement



example of name_space

'[SYSTEM~SYSTEM]LaCima Operations:
 [SITE~SITE]LaCima:
 [DATA_STORE~DATA_STORE]LaCima_DataStore:
 [MOISTURE_STORE~MOISTURE_STORE]MOISTURE_STORE:
 [MOISTURE_DATA~MOISTURE_DATA]moisture_1:'
                  
 In influxdb the data base is fixed by specifing the db or issuing a USE DATABASE command.
 select statements apply to series in the database
 
currently the select statement has the following form
"select * from moisture_d "
or 
select value, depth, sensor_number from moisture_d where depth < 10.

also time is allowed as a query object as time is an implicit field

select value, depth, sensor_number from moisture_d where time > "2017-04-04"
